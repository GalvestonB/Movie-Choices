Description
Business Context and Problem Statement: 

MovieLens is a company in the internet and entertainment domain providing an online database of information related to films, television series, and online streaming content including cast, production crew, trivia, ratings, fan, and critical reviews. Every year in collaboration with a guest curator, MovieLens publish their annual insights based on a theme providing a comprehensive view of a topic. The company is planning to bring out the "Movie Talkies: Classic" edition this year. The idea is to connect with viewers who have strong movie preferences as well as promote classic movies to attract newer customers and expand their viewer base.

Problem Statement:

In order to create the "Movie Talkies: Classic" edition, the challenge lies in effectively analyzing and presenting a wealth of information about movies from a bygone era. The core issue is understanding the characteristics of these classic movies, user interests, and the relationship between user demographics and movie ratings. Without clear visuals, it's difficult to identify patterns, draw meaningful conclusions, and engage the audience on a deeper level. You have been hired as a Data Analyst by the company, to create a report that provides a detailed analysis of the classic movies that were released till 2000. The dashboard should provide insights on the following questions:

MY TAKE:
Use this page to decide what old movies you may like based on what other people liked with similar occupations, gender, ages or locations. Click through to find ten suggestions, and descriptions of those movies.

Unless you are deep in the movie industry or analyzing specific films, you don't care about the types of people who like which films - you want to know if they have any wisdom for helping you choose good films. So I used the same data, but added first, zip code data so that I could connect people to general state areas, rather than random zip codes addresses, and second, more detailed movie information to help viewers decide if they agreed with the suggestions. I did a web crawl for short movie descriptions from IMDB, and pulled up the top hundred films for each decade, but very few matched the data I had. So, I found a kaggle database from BERIDZEG45 who had already pulled significantly more data from IMDB, and pulled movie descriptions for almost two thirds of the movies in the MovieLens database.
